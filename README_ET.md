# group-project-pyflu
Analysing factors that influence influenza transmission globally.



For the readme
This portion of the readme is referring to the section of the group project done by Eric Tran.
In the script “Project_influenza.ipynb” , it contains codes which are used to take raw data from the CSV dataset in the ‘Resources’ and convert into two graphs which showcases:
1.	Line graph that shows the changes in total number of influenza case by year, with the various countries as references
2.	Scatter plot where for each of the same chosen countries as before, the X value is the county’s total population, and the y value is the 2022 total influenza case
In order for the code to successfully work, there needs to be two CSV files in the Resources folder for it to work;
-	flu_gpd_summary.csv
-	country_population.csv
When the code successfully read the CSV files, then the rest of code should work.
When it comes to altering the list of countries for a different, that can be done by changing the series from the ‘country_list’ and either add or remove a country. Therefore, there isn’t any need of heavy changes in regards to the coding that displays the graphs.
